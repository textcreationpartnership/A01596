            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Rochette</hi> chiefe Preſedent of the Senat of <hi>Chambery</hi> to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Geneua,</hi> to let them vnderſtand that hee was reſolued to liue in peace with them, ſince it hath pleaſed the French kings Maieſtie to haue comprehended them in the treatize of peace betwixt him and the King: and that they might be ſure that hee would obſerue it inuiolable in euery poynt.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> (an olde and haynous enemie vnto <hi>Geneua</hi>) did depart from <hi>Thurin</hi> on Tueſday the .vii. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ariued at a Towne called <hi>La-Roche,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Geneua</hi> foure of their Leagues: where hee had three thouſand men, ſome <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> ſome <hi>Italians,</hi> and ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyers:</hi> who on Saterday the .xi. of the ſame month the ſame night, hauing called vnto him their chiefe Captaines and Leaders, did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vnto them his enterpriſe, exhorting them to behaue them ſelues valiantly: out of the which, he made choyce of three hundred of the braueſt and reſoluteſt of them, to giue the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
            <p>From thence they marched towardes the Citie of <hi>Geneua</hi> at one of the clocke after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, where they ariued about two of the clocke in the night: the Duke himſelfe ſtayed ſome quarter of a League from <hi>Geneua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Monſieur Dalbigny,</hi> who was his Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall (and the chiefe of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe)

            <p>Moreouer, hee made them to promiſe, that they ſhould not defile any Mayden or Woman: nor fall to pillage, till they had receyued the ſignall from him.</p>
            <p>This ended, they approched the Walles of the Cittie, beeing fauoured with the darkneſſe of the night, a thicke miſt, and ſharpe winde, and cauſed his men to caſt into the Towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch certaine Faggots: on the which they rayſed three Ladders, in a ranke tyed togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. (It was in a place diſtant ſome fiftie Paces from the Sentinell, betwixt the <hi>New-gate</hi> and the <hi>Money-gate.</hi>) The firſt (being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout threeſcore in number) all Shot, entred the Cittie.

            <p>The Citizens hearing it, armed themſelues

            <p>But howſoeuer they vſed all diligence, it was impoſſible for them to hinder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ſome three hundred of the Enemie, (which were as hath been ſayd) all Captaines and Commaunders, men of authoritie and courage, armed from top to too: as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode afterwardes by the confeſſion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Enemie placed themſelues in order vpon the Walles of that quarter, in a place diſtant from the <hi>Corps du Gard</hi> ſome two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces, endeuoring to poſſeſſe the <hi>New-gate,</hi> and ſo to giue entraunce by their <hi>Petart</hi> vnto their Men, which ſtayed without at the Bridge-foote.</p>
            <p>Comming neare vnto the ſayd place with their <hi>Petart,</hi> he that caryed it, and ſhould haue fyred it, was killed by an <hi>Ambúſcado.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gate (where there were but twentie and fiue men of the Citie) was loſt and wonne againe three times: yet the Enemie was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſtrayned to retire, by the meanes of an <hi>Italian</hi> Captaine called <hi>Brandano,</hi> comming from the Towne-houſe of the Cittie with ſome

            <p>The Enemie ſeeing themſelues thus put backe, did ſeeke to get the Gate called <hi>Tartaſe:</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they were repulſed by the meanes of the <hi>Corps du Garde.</hi> From thence they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards the <hi>Mony-gate,</hi> intending to force it, but all in vaine: for the Portcullis was let downe, and the Chaines vp, and fiue hundred Citizens were appoynted to guard the hart of the Cittie.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, thoſe of the Citie aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Enemies through the houſes which were neare vnto the Walles of the Cittie: but the Enemie gaue great reſiſtaunce, and came ſtill vp by the Ladders, to the number of three hundred: whereby their courage encreaſed much, and fought valiantly; crying-out as loud as they could (but eſpecially a Trumpetter ſtanding vpon the Walles) <hi>Viue LE'ſpaigne, viue Sauoye: <hi>God ſaue Spaine and Sauoy:</hi>
               </hi> the Towne is wonne.</p>
            <p>They forced two Houſes neare the Wall with two <hi>Petarts,</hi> and many of their chiefeſt Men thereby entred the Houſes, meaning thereby to gaine the place called <hi>La Monnoye:</hi> but ſodainely they were conſtrayned to retire,

For the Enemie hauing perceiued that by the diſcharging of a Canon, that was on the Bulwarke of the <hi>New-gate,</hi> being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Chaynes and Nayles, one of their Ladders beeing broken, and betwixt thirtie and fourtie of their men (which were comming vp) ſore maymed, were greatly aſtoniſhed, and none of them durſt afterwards come vp: Thoſe which were got into the Cittie, were alſo much amazed, and began to flye, hearing the ſound of the Retraite, running downe with more haſte then they came vp: a part of them did fall head-long downe into the Ditch: the reſt, beeing an hundred, or ſixſcore, were either killed, or ſore hurt: except thirteene, who being taken aliue, refuſing to confeſſe any thing, were hanged the ſame day, notwithſtanding their offering of great Ranſome.</p>
            <p>The fight dured from three of the clocke to fiue.</p>

The Enemie retired themſelues to a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Etrenblieres,</hi> diſtant ſome League from <hi>Geneua,</hi> carying many of their dead and maimed men: amongſt the which were the Baron <hi>De La Valdiſaire,</hi> Generall of the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and many others of Commaund: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ariued at <hi>Roche,</hi> and making a reuiew of their men, found betwixt three and foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them wanting.</p>
            <p>The Duke cauſed foure Captaines (beeing <hi>Spaniards</hi>) to be hanged, for not executing their charge, in aſſaulting of the towne on the other ſide: which being done, he himſelfe rode poſt to <hi>Thurin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Cittie loſt ſome ſixteene men: amongſt whom, was <hi>Monſieur Canal,</hi> one of the Priuie-counſel, being three ſcore and tenne yeares olde, Captaine <hi>Vandell, Marke Cambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ago, Peter Cabriol,</hi> Maſſter <hi>Nicholas, Maſſon, Bandieres, Debolo,</hi> and ſome others: and ſome twentie hurt.</p>
            <p>The Cittie was preſently relieued with three hundred <hi>Swytſers</hi> of <hi>Berna,</hi> being their neighbours and confederates, looking dayly for more: Prayſing the Lord for this great and wonderfull deliuerance: a ſinguler conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his mercy, that hee laughing at their
<pb facs="tcp:3164:7"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 105 -->complots, had taken the cauſe of his people into his owne hands: and as a iuſt Iudge, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiting their Enemies, hath made them ſinke downe into the Pit, which they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thoſe that know the Lord, and truſt in him. <hi>Let therefore <hi>Iſrael</hi> truſt in the Lord, for with the Lord is mercie and great redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF all this Narration there is a double vſe, and he that hath a ſanctifyed hart, ſhall (no doubt) profit by it therein.</p>
            <p>Firſt, wee may ſee what affiance or truſt is to bee giuen to the wordes and promiſes of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction: of the which, the <hi>Sauoyard</hi> is not one of the leaſt limbes or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and that ſhould mooue vs not to bee ſo readie to relie or reſt vpon their fayre wordes and ſpeaches, as ſome would haue vs, but to carry our ſelues (if not ſuſpitious of them, yet warily with them: and the rather, becauſe it is a receiued maxime amongſt them, and as one would ſay, an ouerruled caſe) that Fayth is not to be held with Heretickes, ſuch as they (vniuſtly) hold vs to bee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee may behold that great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, and more then fatherly care that the Lord hath to preſerue and defend them, that with godly ſinceritie and ſingleneſſe of hart, walke in the obedience of his whole trueth:
<pb facs="tcp:3164:7"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 105 -->and that ſhould on the one ſide prouoke vs to bee more zelous of his glory, then in theſe cold and careleſſe dayes many men would haue vs, and wee are in deede. And on the other ſide, it ſhould ſtirre vs vp with confidence of hart, and aſſurance of hope, wholly to depend vpon him: who, though for the tryall of our Fayth, the proofe of our Patience, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sinnes, and ſundry other cauſes, beſt knowne to his owne Wiſedome, hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt vs to bee ſundry wayes exerciſed, yet will together with the temptation, make an iſſue out of the ſame, and prouide a way for vs to eſcape, as ſhall bee moſt for his glory, and our good: And this ſhould bee no meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto vs, in the dayes of our tryalles and tribulations.</p>
